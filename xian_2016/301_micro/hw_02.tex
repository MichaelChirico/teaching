\section{Leontief \& Substitution}

An individual has Leontief preferences over goods $x_1$ and $x_2$. He starts with income $y$ and the two goods have respective prices $p_1$ and $p_2$.

The price of good $x_2$ increases to $p_2^{'}$. Decompose this individual's change in demand into income and substitution effects.

\section{CES Demand}

Another commonly used class of utility functions is CES utility, which stands for \textbf{constant elasticity of substitution}. In general they take the form:

\[
u(x_1, x_2) = \left(\theta x_1^{\rho} + (1-\theta) x_2^{\rho}\right)^{\frac1{\rho}}
\]

If we take $\theta = \frac12$, these are equivalent to

\[
u(x_1, x_2) = \left(x_1^{\rho} + x_2^{\rho}\right)^{\frac1{\rho}}
\]

\begin{enumerate}
\item Derive the demand for CES utility with $\theta = \frac12$, i.e., find $x_1(p_1, p_2, y)$ and $x_2(p_1, p_2, y)$.
\item Decompose a change in the price of good 1 from $p_1$ to $p_1^{'}$ into substitution and income effects.
\end{enumerate}
